## Onboarding.stopOnboarding() method

Stops onboarding registration, including removing the injected forwarder (if any)

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
stopOnboarding(): void;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

Typically this function is not necessary, but it can be useful for cases where onboarding completes before the forwarder has registered.
